  "description": "Apply a cinematic color grading style with the following characteristics:  Dominant cool tones, including teal, green, and blue in the shadows and midtones. Warm highlights with shades of mustard yellow, beige, and earthy brown. Slight desaturation of colors to create a muted and subdued look. Shadows with a greenish tint for a cold and somber atmosphere. Highlights leaning towards soft yellows and beiges for subtle contrast. Maintain a balance between warm and cool tones to ensure harmony in the overall color palette. Avoid overly bright or saturated colors to preserve the subdued and nostalgic mood.",

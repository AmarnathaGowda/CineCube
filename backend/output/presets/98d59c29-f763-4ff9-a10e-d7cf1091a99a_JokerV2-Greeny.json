  "description": "Apply a dramatic and high-contrast cinematic color grading style with the following characteristics:  Deep green tones dominating the shadows and midtones. Vibrant teal and emerald green highlights for a striking visual impact. Subtle use of warm accents, including mustard yellow and earthy brown, to create contrast against the cool greens. Ensure the lighting is low-key, emphasizing shadows and giving the scene a moody and enclosed feel. Slight desaturation of non-dominant colors to keep the focus on greens and yellows. Maintain a rich, saturated look for greens while allowing warm colors to pop subtly without overpowering the overall palette.",
